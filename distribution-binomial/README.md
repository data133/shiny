# Binomial Distribution

This is a Shiny app that graphs a probability histogram of the Binomial
distribution, given its number of trials, and the probability of success in 
a given trial.

## How to run it?

One quick way to run the app is with the `"shiny"` function `runGitHub()` as follows:

```R
library(shiny)

runGitHub(
  repo = "shiny", 
  username = "data133", 
  subdir = "distribution-binomial")
```
