# Tossing a Coin

This is a Shiny app that graphs a timeline to visualize the (cumulative)
proportion of heads in a series of tosses of a coin.



## How to run it?

One quick way to run the app is with the `"shiny"` function `runGitHub()` as follows:

```R
library(shiny)

runGitHub(
  repo = "shiny", 
  username = "data133", 
  subdir = "toss-coin")
```
