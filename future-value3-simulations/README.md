# Basic Investing Simulator

This app simulates investing a lump sum for a number of years. 
The rate of return for every year is a variable rate that is randomly 
generated according to a uniform distrib.


## How to run it?

One quick way to run the app is with the `"shiny"` function `runGitHub()` as follows:

```R
library(shiny)

runGitHub(
  repo = "shiny", 
  username = "data133", 
  subdir = "future-value3-simulations")
```
